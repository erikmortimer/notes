#Important thoughts about what to do for my next application using Vue and Django (to get some practice using this stack)

- Work on the recipe app with Alex

- Create an app by myself
    - Reddit clone?
    - IM chat app?
    - Video game?
    - Crypto/stock investing tool with the addition of implementing algorithms to track and analyis prices?
    - Something to organize data, and display critical info
        - Like, the speedrunning application i was thinking about for a while now
        - Or the server finding application
        - Game server stats page?
        - I guess a dashboard of some sort
   
- Interests
    - Drinks like Whiskey and beer
    - Playing video games

- I really don't want to make something that has been done hundreds of times before
    - Need to make something that I will personally use on a day to day basis

- Something relating to Minecraft?
    - But at the sametime I would like to make something talored to Hytale, since I am super hyped about that game

- Something relating to Music
    - A place to share music with friends
    - Unique profile, displays what kind of music you listen to
    - Could use the Spotify API to make this happen
