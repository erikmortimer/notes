# Potential Tweets I can do on Twitter
## Brainstorming thoughts

### Tweet Images with Posts
I think I should try and make memes with GIMP and post them on twitter.
    - Requires me to learn how to use GIMP again and use it efficient and effectively too

Memes get a shit ton of engagement on the platform, so I should probably make use of it

### Tweet Topics
I really don't want to copy and paste what other people have done on twitter (so much Javascript tutorials, tips and tricks, guides, etc)
    - Seems like that topic is super crouded
    - Plus, I don't think I want to have an audience like that
I want to think of creating content that is different that what is posted on there 
(plus, what I am doing right now is pretty niche too that being Python, Rust, and using other frameworks like Django and Vue)

Programming Basics (idk if I want to do this, since this is not the audience I want to attract)

Rust

Python
    - Django

Vue
    - Reasons to use Vue compared to other Angular or React
    - Best resources to start learning about Vue
    - Best Practices
    - Single File Components
    - What are Solts in Vue?
